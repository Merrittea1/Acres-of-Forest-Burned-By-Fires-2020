## Area Burned by Wildfires in the United States in Acres

### Introduction

##### This application allows the user to visualize acres burned by forest fire in all 50 states. Acreage values are represented by a proportional symbol map. The user is able to scroll and pan the entire global map, though data only exists for the United States.

### Major Functions

##### This map features a highlighted quality when scrolling over circles so the user can be sure which circle their mouse is over. The map is pannable and adjustable. The title is stagnant and will always be present in the upper left corner. A link to the original data source is located in the bottom right of the map.

### Libraries and Data Sources

##### The map coordinantes are in a geoJson, that was created from an CSV file. The CSV file was then converted into a GPX before being converted into a GeoJson. The basemap was provided by leaflet libraries and created by JawgMaps. The map is called Jawg_Matrix. My data was provided by [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/217072/number-of-fires-and-acres-burned-due-to-us-wildfires/)
